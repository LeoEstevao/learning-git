# About Git

Git is a version control system, that works with 3 stages:

* `Working Directory` = Local Repository

* `Staging Area` = Queue for files changes

* `Git Directory` = Project repository on server


# About GitHub 
Github is a online control version platform that let us share our projects with others users or modify/update our projects from different devices


>After installing GIT (on windows, because linux has it natively), we need to do some globals setting to the properly use with github: 

# Using SSH (Secure Shell) on Github

>Github needs your permission to sync your account with your device. We'll generate a ssh and copy that key
>	On git bash:
	ssh-keygen

>Then we'll copy that key of the file, and use it to give permission to access our github:
>	Directory:
	User/.ssh/id_rsa.pub



**Branch** = A parallel project, that can be modified or updated without any directly interference with the main project.

**Pull request** = Is a request to evaluate the 'diffs' of your project from the main project, so they can be merged (if successful).

**Merge** = Mesclar qualquer alteração feita, ao repositório 'branch master'.
**Merge** = Merge any update/modification to the main project.




## Git Resume

Git is commonly used on command lines interfaces (CLI), that's why we need to know the main linux-cli commands.

**`CLEAR`**	-> Clear prompt screen.

**`CD`** 	-> Change directory (cd 'any folder')

**`TOUCH`** -> Create a file (touch index.html)

**`MKDIR`** -> Create a directory/folder (mkdir 'new folder')
